I would like to mutate the input array <code>A</code>, but I am not sure, if it is safe, as I don't have much experience with parallel computation. Basically, I am running <code>tmap!(f, A, A)</code>. Each calculation of <code>f(A[i])</code> is independent of other elements of <code>A</code>. There shouldn't be any racing happening, right? Each thread works on its own elements?</p>",
